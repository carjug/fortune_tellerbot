This is a repo for my Twitter Bot that predicts people's future based on their wishful tweets. Follow her at @CirceNurse if you want you want to know what your future holds <3

- Anticipate spending 10-15 hours on this project over the break week.
- Do at least an hour of thinking and research about a small, web-based project you would like to build. Focus on something you believe you can ship by the end of the week.
- Spend time thinking about the scope of the project. What does done look like? What is the __minimum viable project__ that you could ship that accomplishes the goal of your project?
- Author and push a README (in plain text or markdown) that describes your project:
  - What is the goal of the project?
  - Who is the target audience (can be just yourself)?
  - What are your personal learning goals?
  - What technologies/frameworks/patterns will you be employing?
  - What are the tech and/or skill dependencies of your project?
  - What does success look like for this project? What does _done_ mean?
- Creat a Trello board in which you decompose the tasks and deliverables of the project.

__Once you have completed the baseline, add Jeremy and Kari as collaborators to your repository on Github and to your project's Trello board. This baseline is due by 9pm on Sunday, September 6.__
