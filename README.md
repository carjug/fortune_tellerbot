# fortune_tellerbot
This is a repo for my Twitter Bot that predicts people's future based on their wishful tweets. Follow her at @CirceNurse if you want you want to know what your future holds <3

- Anticipate spending 10-15 hours on this project over the break week.
- Do at least an hour of thinking and research about a small, web-based project you would like to build. Focus on something you believe you can ship by the end of the week.
- Spend time thinking about the scope of the project. What does done look like? What is the __minimum viable project__ that you could ship that accomplishes the goal of your project?
- Author and push a README (in plain text or markdown) that describes your project:
  - What is the goal of the project?
    + To further learn how to consume the Twitter API, search for tweets with a given set of words, and publish tweets in response automatically.
  - Who is the target audience (can be just yourself)?
    + Myself and anyone else who thinks its funny. I might be the only one.
  - What are your personal learning goals?
    + Explore the enigmatic world of bots. Understand how automation of code works at a basic level.
  - What technologies/frameworks/patterns will you be employing?
    + Ruby/Rails, TDD, Rspec, Factory Girl and VCR (to mimick API hits)
  - What are the tech and/or skill dependencies of your project?
    + Heroku and Twitter API is the biggest tech dependency that I can think of. A big skill dependency is knowing how to automate my code to execute without the physical press of a button -- hooooowwww?! With heroku?? So crazy. So excite.
  - What does success look like for this project? What does _done_ mean?
    + Success is getting my bot to tweet in response to certain keywords in tweets (maybe hashtags?). Ideally I want to set up automation of my bot through a heroku app, but complications may arise there, due to the fact that I never done that before. So for now MVP is a Twitter Bot that responds to tweets containing a given set of keywords.
- Creat a Trello board in which you decompose the tasks and deliverables of the project.

__Once you have completed the baseline, add Jeremy and Kari as collaborators to your repository on Github and to your project's Trello board. This baseline is due by 9pm on Sunday, September 6.__
