[Bot Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/79G8V6kl/fortune-teller-bot)
  - What is the goal of the project?
    + To further learn how to consume the Twitter API, search for tweets with a given set of words, and publish tweets in response automatically.
  - Who is the target audience (can be just yourself)?
    + Myself and anyone else who thinks its funny. I might be the only one.
  - What are your personal learning goals?
    + Explore the enigmatic world of bots. Understand how automation of code works at a basic level.
  - What technologies/frameworks/patterns will you be employing?
    + Ruby/Rails, Heroku, TDD, Rspec, Factory Girl and VCR (to mimick API hits)
  - What are the tech and/or skill dependencies of your project?
    + Heroku and Twitter API is the biggest tech dependency that I can think of. A big skill dependency is knowing how to automate my code to execute without the physical press of a button -- hooooowwww?! With heroku?? So crazy. So excite.
  - What does success look like for this project? What does _done_ mean?
    + Success is getting my bot to tweet in response to certain keywords in tweets (maybe hashtags?). Ideally I want to set up automation of my bot through a heroku app, but complications may arise there, due to the fact that I never done anything like automation before. So for now MVP is a Twitter Bot that responds to tweets containing a given set of keywords. Automation is the next step from MVP.
